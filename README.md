5. Once a user is created an account on Spotty, they can make custom playlists of 5 songs.
6. **Frontend**: We have 5 pages (loading, login, main, making playlist, opening a playlist). We use the API created by the backend team. We have multiple custom adapters (playlistAdapter and songAdapter) that lists the playlists and songs. **Backend**: We have more than 4 routes (9), We have two tables, a user table and playlist table, which has a one to many relationship. We made a full API spec that the frontend used.
